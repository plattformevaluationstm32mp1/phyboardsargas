Release Note of STM32CubeMX-phytec package
===========================================

STM32CubeMX-phytec-PD22.1.0.zip - 2022-07-12:
=============================================
This package has been created from previous archive (STM32CubeMX-phytec-PD21.2.1.zip) adding the changes described below.

Changes:
--------

  - CubeMX project:

     * Update MP1 Firmware Package to V1.5.0
        - Update all projects using STM32CubeMX v6.4.0:
          - FW_MP1 (MP1 MCU firmware package) is migrated to V1.5.0.
          - Doing this migration, openstlinux setting change automatically (in STM32CubeMX tool) to "openstlinux-5.10-dunfell-mp1-21-11-17" manifest.


  - DeviceTree_templates:

     * tf-a: align with v2.4-phy3
        - Update regulator description to match with pmic driver updates.
        - "vref_ddr" does not support over-current protection.
        - "vtt_ddr" is set to sink source mode.

     * u-boot: align with v2020.10-phy3
        In this version of u-boot, the device tree node property "st,eth-clk-sel" is now aligned with the kernel device tree.
        Previously it contained underscore instead of dash in u-boot. There is no more need to correct it in "-mx-u-boot.dtsi" files.

     * kernel: align with v5.10-phy2
        - align "vdev0vring0" and "vdev0vring1" reserved size.
        - align "gpu_reserved" address and size.
        - add "add mcu_rsc_table" memory region.


  - Phytec-CubeMX_info.txt:

     * Update the note to match the new versions:
        - STM32CubeMX v6.4.0
        - MP1 Firmware Package to V1.5.0
        - "openstlinux-5.10-dunfell-mp1-21-11-17" manifest
        - PHYTEC BSP PD22.1.0

     * Improve the note for best understanding of the package usage.



STM32CubeMX-phytec-PD21.2.1.zip - 2021-12-07:
=============================================
This package has been created from previous archive (PCM-068-CubeMX-PD21.2.0.zip) adding a change described below.

Changes:
--------
  - DeviceTree_templates:

     * u-boot: align with "2020.10-phy2" PHYTEC u-boot-stm32mp upstream version (PD21.2.1).
       This alignment allows to fix a u-boot ethernet issue present in "2020.10-phy1" (not functionnal).
       In this u-boot version, "st,eth-clk-sel" is not aligned with the kernel device tree and must
       contains underscore instead of dash.
       So we add this property with correct typo in the "-mx-u-boot.dtsi" files and this fix the issue.



STM32CubeMX-phytec-PD21.2.0.zip - 2021-11-04:
=============================================
This package has been created from previous archive (PCM-068-CubeMX-PD21.1.1.zip) adding some changes described below.

Changes:
--------

  - CubeMX project:

     * Disable QUADSPI IP for some phycore-stm32mp1-5 projects:
       QUADSPI must be disabled for the phycore-stm32mp1-5 machines (no SPI NOR). It was not the case for some of those projects, so we correct this.

     * Update MP1 Firmware Package to V1.4.0
        - Update all projects using CubeMX v6.2.1:
          - FW_MP1 (MP1 MCU firmware package) is migrated to V1.4.0.
          - Doing this migration, openstlinux setting change automatically (in STM32CubeMX tool) to "openstlinux-5.10-dunfell-mp1-21-03-31" manifest.

     * Enabled CRC1 HW block by default for all projects as done in upstream device tree.


  - DeviceTree_templates:

     * u-boot and kernel: remove QSPI disabled status:
       The QSPI status node must me removed from User code section. The status to use is the one set automatically by CubeMX.

     * tf-a: update the automatic code output
        - add PPL1 config
        - update compatible board name
        - FMC node
       (No functional modifications as no user code sections are touched).

     * u-boot: align with "2020.10-phy1" PHYTEC u-boot-stm32mp upstream version

     * kernel: align with "5.10-phy1" PHYTEC linux-stm32mp upstream version



STM32CubeMX-phytec-PD21.1.1.zip - 2021-11-04:
=============================================
This package has been created from previous archive (PCM-068-CubeMX-V2.zip) adding some changes described below.

Changes:
--------

- DeviceTree_templates: kernel: rtc-rv3028: enable level switching mode
  Enabling this driver mode is necessary to backup the rtc when power supply is off.
  This allow to align device tree output with PHYTEC BSP PD21.1.1.



PCM-068-CubeMX-V2.zip (to use with BSP PD21.1.0) - 2020-03-04:
==============================================================
Package creation:

- STM32CubeMX project-files (.ioc) created with STM32CubeMX Version v6.1.1:
  * MP1 MCU Firmware Package set to V1.3.0
  * openstlinux setting is set automatically (in STM32CubeMX tool) to "openstlinux-5.4-dunfell-mp1-20-11-12" manifest

- Device Tree sources templates (.dts, .dtsi) based on PHYTEC BSP PD21.1.0
